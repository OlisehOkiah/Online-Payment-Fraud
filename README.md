# Online Payment Fraud Detection

## Project Description
This project focuses on identifying fraudulent online payment transactions using machine learning techniques. By analyzing transaction data, we built a predictive model to detect fraudulent activities with high accuracy.



## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SMOTE, Streamlit

## Dataset
- Source:kaggle
- Size: 1 million+ transactions
- Features: Transaction amount, timestamps, payment methods, etc.

## Key Features
- Built a decision tree model with 99.94% accuracy.
- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE.
- Deployed the model as a Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.

## How to Use
- Upload a dataset of transactions or enter transaction details manually.
- The app will predict whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.

## Results and Insights
- Achieved an accuracy of 99.94%.
- Improved fraud detection rate by 15% compared to traditional methods.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional features for better prediction.
- Expand deployment to cloud services for scalability.
